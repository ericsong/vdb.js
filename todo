Goal
    Let users easily view their data structures
        -Must be easy to use
            -Easy to import library (copy/paste code if needed)
            -Easy to call library (simple function call)
        -Visual
            -Easy to navigate structure
            -Nice to look at

Target
    Beginner programmers (CS111 / CS112)
        -Should be implemented in Java, Python, JS as they are three of the most popular languages used in beginner courses

Implementation
    -Front end needs to specify an input standard that client library adhere to.
    Makes it easier to implement support for new languages and be open sourced
    productively

Supported Structures
    -Primitive Types
    -Array
    -Map/Dictionary
    -List
        -Linked List
        -Queue
        -Stack
    -Tree
    -Graph // Needs to be broken down
